# Agent ALO – Training Repository

This repository contains my daily Python training projects and exercises, guided step by step by my Trainer.  
The goal: **to build strong foundations in Python, Git, and technical troubleshooting.**

## 🚀 Progress So Far
- **Day 2**: `hello.py` → First Python script (“Hello Alphonce – future top engineer from Nairobi!”).
- **Day 4**: `Day4_marker.txt` → Git test commit (marker file).
- **Day 5**: `vars_if_exercises.py` → Variables, input, if/else practice.
- **Day 6**: `calculator.py` → CLI calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide with error handling).
- **Day 8**: `functions_example.py` → Functions and reusable code.
